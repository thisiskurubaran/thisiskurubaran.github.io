# Tide Privacy Policy

Effective 7 November 2026
{: .meta}

Tide is a code editor with a terminal for iPhone and iPad, made by
Kurubaran Anandhan ("I", "me"). This policy explains what happens to your
information when you use Tide. If you have questions, email
[thisiskurubaran@gmail.com](mailto:thisiskurubaran@gmail.com).

## Summary

- Tide has no accounts, no ads, no analytics and no tracking. I don't sell
  or share your data.
- Your projects, settings and credentials stay on your device.
- Tide only sends data off your device when you use a feature that needs
  it, and only to the place that feature talks to (for example your Git
  host, a package registry or the AI provider you choose).
- The only data that can reach me is a crash report, if you turn crash
  reports on, and an email, if you choose to write to me.

## Data stored on your device

Tide keeps the following on your device, in its own storage:

- **Projects and files** you create, import, clone or open, and
  **snapshots** (automatic copies of a project you can restore).
- **Settings**: theme, editor options, snippets, key bar layout, recent
  projects and similar preferences.
- **Local history**: earlier versions of the files you save, so you can
  compare and restore them.
- **Offline docs** you download, and which ones.
- **HTTP history**: the last responses to the requests you send from .http
  files, without credential headers such as Authorization and Cookie.
- **AI data**: the models and server address you choose, your limits, this
  month's usage, the agent's changes waiting for your review, and the
  commands you chose to always allow.
- **Widget data**: the names of your projects and recent
  projects are shared with Tide's widget and Siri and Shortcuts actions
  through an app group on your device. Live Activities show the status of a
  run or deploy, such as its command or project name, on your Lock Screen
  and in the Dynamic Island.
- **Credentials**, kept in the iOS Keychain: your Git name, email and
  access token (also used for GitHub when you sign in to it), the Remote
  server address and token, the tokens and keys you add for deploying
  (Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare, a Firebase service account) and Render
  deploy hook URLs, your SSH servers and their saved commands,
  passwords and private keys, your database servers and their passwords,
  GitLab and Bitbucket tokens, your AI provider API keys, and environment variables you keep as
  secrets. SSH private keys never leave your device, and secret environment
  variables are never written to your projects.

Tide's storage is included in your device backups (iCloud Backup or a
computer) like any app's data. Deleting Tide deletes it from the device.
I never receive any of it.

## Data sent off your device, and where

These features connect to other services only when you use them. Those
services see the request and your IP address, as any website would, and
handle it under their own privacy policies.

| Feature | What is sent | To |
|---|---|---|
| Git (clone, pull, push) | Your repository's contents and history, your Git name and email (in commits), and your access token | The Git host you use, e.g. GitHub |
| GitHub (sign-in, repositories, pull requests, issues, Actions) | Your GitHub access token, and what you do on those screens: comments, reviews, new issues and pull requests, merges, re-runs | GitHub (github.com and api.github.com) |
| GitLab and Bitbucket | Your token (and for Bitbucket, your Atlassian account email), and what you do on those screens: comments, approvals, merges, new issues | GitLab (gitlab.com or the GitLab address you enter) or Bitbucket (bitbucket.org and api.bitbucket.org) |
| Deploy | The files in the folder you publish, the token you added for that service, and settings such as the site or project name and, for previews, the Git branch's name. For Firebase, a sign-in token signed on your device with your service account key; the key itself isn't sent. | The service you choose: GitHub Pages, Firebase Hosting (Google), Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, or Render (only a request to your deploy hook) |
| SSH and SFTP | Your username and password or a signature made with your key (the private key itself is never sent), your terminal input, the files you open, save or copy, and the traffic of ports you forward | The server you add, and the jump host you connect through, if any. They're run by you or whoever gave you access, not by me. |
| HTTP and WebSocket requests (.http files) | The requests and messages you send, including any headers and bodies you write, and any environment variables you put in them | The address in each request |
| AI features (agent, inline completions, Fix with AI, explaining errors, commit messages) | Your API key, your questions, and the code each feature works on. Inline completions: the file's path and the text around the cursor, as you type. Agent: the project's file list and package.json scripts, the files it reads or searches (which can include files such as .env), and the output of the commands it runs. Fix with AI and explaining errors: the code or terminal output involved, and the files it points at or imports. Commit messages: the changes being committed. | The provider you set up, under your own account and its terms: Anthropic (api.anthropic.com), OpenAI (api.openai.com), Google Gemini (generativelanguage.googleapis.com), OpenRouter (openrouter.ai, which passes requests to the model's provider), or the Ollama, LM Studio or other server whose address you enter |
| Databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis and MongoDB) | Your username and password, and the queries and changes you make | The database server you add, directly or through the SSH server you choose. It's run by you or whoever gave you access, not by me. |
| npm and pip installs | Names and versions of the packages you install | The npm registry (registry.npmjs.org) and PyPI (pypi.org) |
| Packages screen | Your search terms, and the names of installed packages to check for updates | The npm registry and PyPI |
| Remote mode | Your project's files, your terminal input, and the server token | The Tide server whose address you enter. That server is run by you or your organisation, not by me. |
| Linked folders | Files copied to and from the folder | The folder you choose, e.g. in iCloud Drive or another app |
| Previews | Whatever the page you preview requests | The page's own server and anything it loads (the React project template, for example, loads React from esm.sh) |
| Offline docs | Which documentation you download (e.g. JavaScript, Python) | DevDocs by freeCodeCamp (devdocs.io and documents.devdocs.io) |
| Sharing and "Open in Tide" | The files you choose | The app or service you pick in the share sheet, or from the app that sent them |
{: .sent }

Tide's AI features do nothing until you set up a provider. Once you do,
inline completions are on and send text as you type, until you turn them off
in **Settings > AI assistant**. Requests go straight from your device to the
provider and never pass through me.

Code you run in Tide's terminal or previews can make its own network
requests; that is up to the code you run. Lua, Ruby and PHP run on your
device, like JavaScript and Python, and SQLite databases you open or query
are read and changed on your device only. Environment variables are given
to the programs you run on your device. The developer tools, OpenAPI
viewer, Mermaid diagrams and PDF export work on your device; an exported
PDF goes only where you send it from the share sheet.

## Ratings

Every feature in Tide is free, and Tide has no in-app purchases. If Tide
asks you to rate it, the rating prompt is shown by Apple, and I only see ratings and reviews as published on the App Store.

## Crash reports (optional, off by default)

If you turn on **Settings > Privacy > Send crash reports**, Tide sends a
report when it crashes to Sentry (Functional Software, Inc.), which
processes it for me. A report contains:

- what went wrong and where in Tide's code (the error and stack trace)
- the app version, device model and iOS version
- a random identifier the Sentry SDK creates for this installation, not
  linked to you or your Apple Account

Before a report leaves the device, Tide removes breadcrumbs, request data,
user data, screenshots and the view hierarchy, and replaces any file path
inside your projects with a placeholder, so reports don't contain your
code, file contents, project names or terminal output. You can turn crash
reports off at any time. Reports are kept by Sentry for a limited period
and used only to find and fix bugs.

## Contacting me

**Settings > Help & feedback** can open an email to me. A problem report
includes the app version, iOS version, device name or model, terminal
mode, and a text file of the app's recent warnings and errors from that
session. Those messages can include parts of file paths (shortened to
`~`) and error messages, which may quote code. You see the whole email
and attachment before sending, and nothing is sent unless you send it. I
use emails only to reply and to fix problems, and delete them when they
are no longer needed.

## Children

Tide is not directed at children under 13 and does not knowingly collect
personal information from them.

## Your choices and rights

Because Tide keeps your data on your device, you can view, change or
delete it in the app, or by deleting the app. Crash reports are optional.
If you want a crash report or email you sent deleted, or have any request
about your data under the laws where you live (such as the GDPR or the
CCPA), email me and I will help.

Crash reports and emails may be processed in countries other than yours,
by Sentry and by my email provider.

## Changes to this policy

If Tide starts handling data differently, I will update this page and the
effective date above before the change ships.
